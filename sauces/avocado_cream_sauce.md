# avocado cream sauce
### ingredients
* avocado
* sour cream
* mayo
* cilantro
* lime juice
* garlic

### how do
1. Combine ingredients in a blender or food processor to desired thickness.

### notes
I store this sauce in a plastic sauce bottle, which has a fairly fine tip. It takes a mew minutes in the food processer to get the garlic and cilarntro broken
up enough to not get stuck in the bottle tip.

# chicken noodle soup
### ingredients - cook
* 3T cooking oil
* onion, any color, chopped fine
* bunch of garlic, to taste, minced (few cloves should be fine, i use 2 heaping spoonfuls out of a jar)
* celery, 4 stalks, chopped fine
* 2 medium-large carrots, chopped fine
* 2 medium - large chicken breasts (i use frozen ones out of a bag)
* 4 cups water
* lots, i mean lots, of salt
* 1 bunch of "poultry blend" fresh herbs, or equivalent (should contain rosemary, thyme, etc)
* 1/2 box any pasta
* 1/8 cup flour

### ingredients -- serve
* half and half

### how do -- cook
1. put 1T oil in a soup pot, along with the onion and garlic. cook on medium heat for 5-10 min
2. add a second 1T of oil and the carrot and celery. cook for another 5-10 min
3. add final 1T of oil, along with flour to the pot. disolve flour in oil, cook for 1 min
4. add water, bit by bit, incorporating into the roux
5. once all the water is consistent texture, add the salt, raw chicken, and herb blend (i just dump the herbs in, but i have to fish them out later. would be smart to wrap them in a cheese cloth or a spice bag, idk)
6. over medium heat, bring just to bubble, then lower heat and cover. cook until chicken is cooked through and can be torn apart with a rubber spatuala
7. cool and store until ready to serve
8. separately, cook pasta according to directions, but just undercook the noodles. maybe a minute less than the package says
9. rinse with cold water to stop cooking. cool, and store with a little bit of oil to keep from sticking together

### how do -- serve
1. put soup serving into pot or pan, along with a splash of half and half
2. as soon as soup starts bubbling, put a handful of cool pasta into the pot
3. serve immediately, and enjoy creamy chicken noodle soup with al dente pasta

### how do - cook
1. add 1T oil and the onion and garlic to a soup pot. cook low heat until onions are cooked, 5-10 min
2. salt and black pepper, and crushed red pepper
3. add second 1T oil to the pot, along with the flour
4. disolve flour in oil, and cook for 1 min (just to get rid of the raw flour taste)

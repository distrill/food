# jalapeno chicken corn chowder 

### ingredients -- cook
* 3T cooking oil
* 1 big onion, chopped fine
* minced garlic to taste (i use 2 heaping spoonfuls from a jar, use fresh if you're an elitist)
* 1-2 jalapenos chopped fine (prepare according to spice preferences. more jalapenos + keeping the seeds = spicier soup)
* 1-2 carrots chopped fine
* 1 medium-large russet potato (or any equivalent thereof) cubed fine (about 1cm)
* 4 stalks of celery chopped fine
* 1/2 bag of frozen corn
* (1/4)C flour
* 1T cumin
* 2T oregano
* 2t garlic powder
* 4 cups chicken broth
* (1+1/2)LB chicken (i prefer raw because it's cheaper, and so easy to just cook in the soup. but use whatever)

### ingredients -- serve
* chopped cilantro to taste
* cotija or feta cheese to taste
* something creamy - plain yogurt, sour cream, half and half - to taste

### how do -- cook
1. add half of the cooking oil to a pan, along with onion, garlic, jalapenos. cook on medium heat for 8 minutes
2. add celery and carrot, cook for another 8 minutes
3. add second half of cooking oil to pan, along with flour and spices. incorporate flour and keep on heat for 1-2 minutes
4. add chicken stock bit by bit at first, incorporating fully before next addition. once about a third is added you can speed this up
5. add raw chicken to soup. bring pot to a bubble before covering and turning heat to very low
6. allow chicken to cool all the way through - it should pull apart with a spoon or rubber spat when it's done
7. bring frozen corn temp up by running hot water over it. add corn to soup and continue cook over low heat for 20 minutes
8. begin serving and let remainder come to room temp before storing it in fridge

### how do -- serve
1. bring serving size up to temp over stove
2. add cream of choice to soup and mix thoroughly
3. serve with chopped cilantro and cheese on top

### notes
* i consider most of the vegetables to be optional - i had carrots and celery on hand from previous cooking when i finally wrote this recipe down. they were fantastic in this soup it's also great without them
* the potato is an interesting chance to thicken the soup additionally if it's not thick enough for you - you can mash them up. or keep them whole and they're tasty little bites
* bacon is another great topper, but i don't often have it on hand

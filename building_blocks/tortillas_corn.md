# tortillas corn

### ingredients

* masa
* salt
* water

### how do

1. mix masa and salt
2. add hot water, little bit at a time. you want to get it so that it just holds together but is crumbly, and then add a little bit more water. too dry and they won't hold up when you move them from the press to the pan
3. smush in a tortilla press and put them on a hot pan
4. flip a few times, consider putting something light on top of them to prevent a single point of contact as bubbles form
5. transfer cooked tortillas into a towel wrap, and ideally let them sit there for a while (10-20 min) to soften up

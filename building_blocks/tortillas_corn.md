# tortillas corn

### ingredients

* masa
* salt
* water

### how do

1. Combine masa and salt.
2. Add hot water, little bit at a time. You want to get it so that it just holds together but is crumbly, and then add a little bit more water. Too dry and they won't hold up when you move them from the press to the pan.
3. Smush in a tortilla press and put them on a hot pan.
4. Flip a few times, consider putting something light on top of them to prevent a single point of contact as bubbles form (I use a spice jar).
5. Transfer cooked tortillas into a towel wrap, and ideally let them sit there for a while (10-20 min) to soften up.

# slow pulled ancho meat
i use pork and chicken pretty interchangably here, depending on what's available. i probably prefer port because the meat flavor is so rich, but chicken is probably 90+% as good and a bit healther.

when using chicken, i prefer a mix of breast and thighs. while boneless skinless is a bit pricer, pulling boned chicken always always always leaves gristle behind in my epxerience, and you don't miss the additional moisture that cooking in-bone would normally provide, as this dish is sauced liberally.

### ingredients
* big boy of pork shoulder, or a bunch of chicken. go for a couple pounds at least
* 4-6 dried ancho chiles, to taste
* huge spoonful of fresh minced garlic, from cloves or a jar doesn't matter IMO
* 1 large white or yellow onion, chopped very rough like the whole thing into 8 pieces
* spoonful of honey or sugar, not necessary but a good balance
* capful of apple cider vinegar
* OPTIONAL celery and/or onion and/or any pepper / aromatics that you have in the fridge - i just do this to get rid of veggies on their way out
* neutral cooking oil
* water to cover everything
* tons of salt and pepper
* oregano

### how do
1. in a dutch oven, start to sear the meat in the cooking oil over mid-high heat. we just want a little bit of color on each side.
2. meanwhile, pour some boiling water over the dried chiles. when they've softened, remove the top stem bits, because they won't break down. but keep the seeds and everything, these chiles are not hot.
3. when the meat has some color on it, add the onion and garlic (and whatever other veg you want to use). we want to see a little bit of fond form, but don't go crazy and don't burn anything.
4. add the chilies and their water, and stir to deglaze
5. add enough water to cover everything, but just barely.
6. put lid on, and cook over lowest possible heat until the meat pulls apart with a rubber spatula. this normally takes 1.5-2 hours for chicken, 3 or so for pork
7. remove all of the meat from the pot. shred it, and keep covered it in a separate bowl.
8. using an imersion blender, blend the sauce up really well. it should be sort of smokey and brown and almost creamy in its consistency, really good stuff.
9. i prefer the sauce to be kind of thick - keep blended sauce over mid-high heat for a while until it thickens to your preference. usually this is about 20 min longer than the meat took to cook.
10. put a small amount into the meat and blend. it shouldn't be coated, this is mostly just used to keep the meat moist while it stores in the fridge.
11. let sauce cool and store next to meat in the fridge.

### notes
my prefered way to serve this is in tacos, but it works just like american bbq pulled pork would work, just a bit more of an interesting flavor.  

you could definitely store more of a sauced meat, but i prefer them separate so you can sauce the meat for the specific dish as they're made to order.

# carne asada      
Is this not a main dish? Fine, eat it on its own, but I use this a ton in other dishes.   
- [x] tacos?
- [x] quesadilla?
- [x] killer lunch salad?       

I generally think about organizing dishes by what time of the week I'm going to prep them. I would like to put together a "dish" in 10 minutes on a tuesday after a busy day at work.  


I would love to use steak in those meals, so I tend to prep a large amount of steak on the weekend, and then use it throughout the week in various dinners.      


This is a building block.        


QED

### ingredients
* 2LB flank or skirt steak
* 2-3 limes, juiced
* 1 orange, juiced
* 2T minced garlic
* 1t crushed red pepper
* 2T-3T salt
* (1/2)C vinegar
* (1/4)C cooking oil

### how do
1. Juice the citrus fruit, put it into a big bowl (one that can be poured out of - we're going to transfer this to a ziplock, so don't use a huge ceramic bowl with no lip or you're gonna have a bad time).
2. Add garlic, salt, oil, and red peper to the mix, and whisk to combine.
3. Cut the steak into grillable-sized pieces - for me they're usually around or under a half pound.
4. Put the steak into a zip lock bag with the marinade, really smush it together so everything's covered. Let sit in your fridge for 8 hours. Take the effort to make sure the entire thing is covered in liquid.
5. Grill Grill Grill! I don't recommend cast iron, because the mariniade is 100% acid, but any other hot pan will work, or any silly indoor grill contraption you have. Or even better, use a real barbecue.
6. A few minutes on each side is fine, usually just until it has grill marks. I recommend slightly undercooking to your expectations, to allow you some breathing room if you want to reheat it when you prep it throughout the week.

### notes
* I prefer skirt steak, but the two cuts are really interchangable, especially in this dish.
* Some people like putting cilantro in their marinade. While it does make the whole thing look more interesting, I find it burns and you don't really taste it - so it's a waste of my favorite herb. I'd rather use it fresh on the dish itself.
* Most recipes for carne asada I find online use white vinegar - I susspect this is because it's cheap. I always have apple cider vinegar on hand, and never white vinegar, so that's what I use. I presume they're completely interchangale, again esp in this dish.

# carne asada      
is this not a main dish? fine, eat it on its own. but i use this a ton in other dishes    
- [x] tacos?
- [x] quesadilla?
- [x] killer lunch salad?
i generally think about organizing dishes by what time of the week i'm going to prep them. i would like to put together a "dish" in 10 minutes on a tuesday after a busy day at work.      
i would love to use steak in those meals, so i tend to prep a large amount of steak on the weekend, and then use it throughout the week in various dinners.      
this is a building block.

### ingredients
* 2LB flank or skirt steak
* 2-3 limes, juiced
* 1 orange, juiced
* 2T minced garlic
* 1t crushed red pepper
* 2T-3T salt
* (1/2)C vinegar
* (1/4)C cooking oil

### how do
1. juice the citrus fruit, put it into a big bowl (one that can be poured out of - we're going to transfer this to a ziplock, so don't use a huge ceramic bowl with no lip or you're gonna have a bad time)
2. add garlic, salt, oil, and red peper to the mix, and whisk to combine
3. cut the steak into grillable sized pieces. for me they're usually around or under a half pound
4. slap the steak into a zip lock bag with the marinade. really smush it together so everything's covered. let sit in your fridge for 8 hours. take the effort to make sure the entire thing is covered in liquid.
5. grill grill grill! i don't recommend cast iron, because the mariniade is 100% acid, but any other hot pan will work. or any silly indoor grill contraption you have. or, use a real barbecue (can you tell i live in a tiny apartment in a city :sad:)
6. a few minutes on each side is fine, usually just until it has grill marks. i recommend slightly undercooking to your expectations, to allow you some breathing room if you want to reheat it when you prep it throughout the week.

### notes
* i prefer skirt steak, but the two cuts are really interchangable, especially in this dish
* some people like putting cilantro in their marinade. while it does make the whole thing look more interesting, i find it burns and you don't really taste it - so it's a waste of my favorite herb. i'd rather use it fresh on the dish itself.
* most recipes for carne asada i find online use white vinegar. i susspect this is because it's cheap. i always have apple cider vinegar on hand, and never white vinegar, so that's what i use. i presume they're completely interchangale, again esp in this dish

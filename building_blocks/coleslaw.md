# coleslaw      
the apple cider vinegar and optional apples make a fairly basic coleslaw a little sweet and crisp .this is great on tacos, sandwiches, next to pulled pork.

### ingredients
##### slaw
* 3 part finely shredded green cabbage (i use part of a bag of coleslaw mix)
* 1 part finely shredded red cabbage (i use part of a bag of coleslaw mix)
* 1 part finely shredded carrot (i use part of a bag of coleslaw mix)
* 1/2 part finely julianned apple (optional)
##### dressing
* 4 parts mayo
* 1/2 part apple cider vinegar
* 1/2 part lime juice
* pinch of salt
* 3 pinches of sugar
* as much black pepper as you can stomach

### how do
1. mix the dressing ingredients together in a bowl with a whisk
2. incorporate the slaw

### notes
some people say that coleslaw gets better in the fridge overnight. i disagree, i think it kind of settles and gets boring. i think it's best after sitting in the marinade for about 10 minutes - the slaw starts to break down but everything is still very crisp and all of the flavors are stil interesting.

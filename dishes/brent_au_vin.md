# brent au vin (coq-au-vin ish)

this dish really highlights the concept of layered flavors. like most recipes, this is very customizable. but what makes this stand out IMO and is worth exploring elsewhere is how the different layers of fond are built up before being incorporated into the next layer. you could get similar flavor profiles by just sticking evertyhing together and browing it at once, but it will be lacking dpeth and there is room for cooking each round of flavors to a more precise level of doneness.

### ingredients
* 6 large bone-in skin-on chicken thighs
* 4 thick strips of bacon, cut into lardons
* 1 large white onion chopped into large (~1 inch square) pieces (more traditional recipes call for pearl onions - a half bag of frozen pearl onions will be fine. but i prefer just using a single fresh onion)
* 1/2 pound of mushrooms, chopped roughly (maybe quarters)
* assorted additional veg - i often have carrot and celery around, and this makes for a mirepoix base when mixed with the onion. this is not a strict interpretation of coq au vin, but it works well with the french techniques in this dish
* 1/8 cup of flour
* 1/3 bottle of any red wine. i like drinking pinot noir so that is often my first choice. this choice will not meaningfully impact the flavor of the recipe.
* 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
* 10 sprigs fresh thyme
* parsley for garnish

### how do
1. put the bacon in a COLD dutch oven (this will go stove top to oven). turn the heat on low until the fat is rendered.
2. once the bacon has cooked to your liking, remove and save for later.
3. turn the heat up to mid or mid-high, and put the chicken thighs (salt and peppered on both sides) into the bacon fat, skin side down.
4. the chicken will not cook through here, but it should obtain a decent brown crispy layer. it should not stick, but there will definitely be some fond now from both the bacon and the chicken.
5. do the same for all sides of the chicken. remove when it looks tasty and crispy (it will still be very raw inside!), and drain all but ~3TB of cooking fat.
6. put the veg into the dutch oven and salt them fairly liberally. we want this to be palatable because we're going to eat it, but we want the salt to draw the moisture out of the mushrooms to deglaze the bacon and chicken fond.
7. the liquid that is pulled from the veg should deglaze the pan at first, but after a few minutes they will start to produce and leave their own fond.
8. add the flour and mix around. if there is still any extra fat sitting around, add a pinch of flour at a time until everything is smooth and roux-y.
9. cook a few minutes and then add the wine. add half at first, making sure the roux is incorporated. do the same with the second half before adding the stock and then finally the thyme as well.
10. add the chicken back to the pot, skin side up. the skins should just peek out over the top of the liquid.
11. put the pan into a 375Â°f oven and cook for 35 to 40 minutes. you can't really overcook chicken thighs, and they actually get better for a while the longer they cook, easier to pull off the bone etc.
12. remove the chicken, and then boil the sauce for a few minutes, remove any scum that appears on top. recipe is ready to plate when sauce reduces to desired thickness.

### serving and extensions
* this is fine to serve as is - chicken thigh on a plate, veggies from the reduction on top of the chicken then lots of sauce over top. garnish with parsley.
* this works really well over a simple starch - mashed potatoes, baked potato wedges, or even over a simple egg noodle.
* if you want to get fancy - make a pizza dough. shred the chicken, and put some of the sauce/veg into an imersion blender. make a pizza with the sauce and mozzeralla cheese. top with parsley and pickled red onions. this is really decadent and pretty interesting. top with ranch. seriously try this.

* [avocado cream sauce](../sauces/avocado_cream_sauce.md)
* [enchilada sauce](../sauces/enchilada_red_sauce.md)

### how do
1. Cook chicken or buy it cooked - cut into cubes or shred.
2. Mix chicken liberally with avocado cream sauce and cheese, plus a litle bit of the enchilada sauce.
3. Put some enchilada sauce into an oven dish
4. Wrap the mixture in tortillas and roll them up - place them on top of sauce in oven dish.
5. Smother enchiladas in the sauce and dump a little more cheese on top for browning.
